# track_dots

This code reads from a video file of a rotating tank, tracks the black dots on the water surface and 
creates trajectories of the dots. It takes about a day to run on a workstation with 12 3.60GHz CPUs. 

The video file can be downloaded using this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bf3pe2n196bji4l/experiment.m4v?dl=0).
